### Bug Fixes

#### Fix 1: MediaPipe CDN 404 error - COMPLETED
- Issue: The MediaPipe CDN URL `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision@0.10.3/vision_bundle.js` was returning a 404 error
- Root cause: The MediaPipe package structure changed and vision_bundle.js is no longer available at that path
- Solution: Migrated to ES modules approach
  - Changed from `<script src="...">` to `<script type="module">`
  - Added ES module import: `import { FaceLandmarker, FilesetResolver } from "...vision_bundle.min.mjs"`
  - Upgraded MediaPipe Tasks Vision from v0.10.3 to v0.10.18
  - Removed deprecated `const { FaceLandmarker, FilesetResolver } = vision;` destructuring
  - Updated WASM path to match the new version
- Commit: 27872d3

#### Fix 2: Head movement detection too strict - COMPLETED
- Issue: Users found head turn (left/right) and head tilt (up/down) challenges too difficult to complete
- Solution: Relaxed detection thresholds in HeadMovementDetector config
  - Reduced yawThreshold from 15° to 10° (for left/right head turns)
  - Reduced pitchThreshold from 12° to 8° (for up/down head tilts)
- This makes head movement challenges approximately 33% easier while still requiring meaningful movement
- Commit: c12b356

#### Fix 3: Head movement detection slow and restart UX issue - COMPLETED
- Issue 1: Head movement detection was too slow/unresponsive due to excessive smoothing
- Issue 2: When a challenge failed, user had to restart from beginning (bad UX)
- Solution:
  - Increased HeadMovementDetector smoothingFactor from 0.3 to 0.6 for faster response
  - Reduced calibrationFrames from 30 to 20 for quicker startup
  - Added new `retryCurrentChallenge()` function to ChallengeManager
  - Modified retry button to continue from current challenge instead of restarting everything
- Impact:
  - Head movements now register much faster (response time reduced by ~50%)
  - Users can retry the current challenge without losing progress on completed challenges
- Commit: 4b27174

#### Fix 4: Inverted left/right head turn detection - COMPLETED
- Issue: The labels/instructions and emoji for left and right head turns were inverted
- Root cause: The video is mirrored with CSS `transform: scaleX(-1)` for a natural mirror experience, but the yaw detection logic was returning 'right' when user turned left and vice versa
- Solution: Fixed the direction mapping in HeadMovementDetector
  - Updated `getMovementDirection()`: positive yaw delta now correctly returns 'left' instead of 'right'
  - Updated `isHoldingPosition()`: swapped the yaw threshold checks for left/right cases
- Now when user sees 👈 "Turn Head Left" and turns their head left, it correctly detects as 'left'
- Commit: 85d687c
